# Hunt the Wumpus
A Hunt the Wumpus clone.
Based on the 1972 game by Gregory Yob. 

## How to Play
Hunt the Wumpus is a 20 room hide and seek style game where you the player have entered a dark cave in search of the elusive Wumpus. The Wumpus is sensitive to even the barest amount of light, thus you must rely on your other senses during this hunt. But this is no walk in the park, the caverns the Wumpus calls home is also filled with pits and bats. 

### The perils
The Wumpus - If startled the Wumpus will run away to give itself a better chance. If it is prepared for you, may God have mercy on your soul.
The Bats - These bats are largely just an annoyance, and will only cause you move to a different section of the cave. But they may drive you to the Wumpus or into one of the many pits
The Pits - These are deep holes that no hunter has yet been able to escape. Some suspect though that the Wumpus digs them to trap the unwary and cocky alike.

### How to Win
Track the Wumpus by its scent, and shoot it when you are close. Be warned though the Wumpus knows it is being hunted and will flee to another section of the cave if you miss.
